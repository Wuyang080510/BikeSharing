# Bike-Sharing
Use Tableau to Create Dashboards and Stories that Showcase the Key Metrics of Bike Sharing Data in New York City.

## Overview
In this bike-sharing analysis project, I created a Tableau story to visualize the key metrics of starting a bike-sharing program in another city based on an NYC CitiBike Bike-Sharing dataset. This analysis report will provide potential investors insights into the opportunity of starting a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. As summer months are the busiest months for bike-sharing businesses, NYC Citi bike-sharing data in August 2019 was used to demonstrate the key metrics for this data visualization project. 

## Purpose of the Project
- Import data into Tableau
- Transform data and create a new field with calculated field
- create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau
- Present data accurately using Tableau dashboards
- Use Tableau worksheets to present data in a professional way

## Results
### Overview of the NYC Bike-Sharing Program
There was a total of 2.34 million trips in August. 81.07% of users are subscribers, and 18.93% of users are customers. Among the 2.34 million bike trips, 65.28% (about 1.53 million) of the trips were made by male riders and 25.10% of the trips were made by females. Male riders use bike-sharing services almost three times as often as female riders. More investigations are needed to understand the reason. 

### Checkout Times (Tripdurations)
From the trip checkout times by users chart, most of the bike trips end within 30 minutes. Over 90% of the trips are less than an hour. If we separate the trip duration by gender, male users and female users have a similar pattern. Male riders' trip duration is slightly longer than female riders. 

### Trips by Weekday and Hour
Users check out bikes between 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM on weekdays and between 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM on weekends. From these facts, we infer that a lot of users use the bike-sharing program to commute during their workdays. And bikes are most likely to be used by tourists for leisure and travel between attractions on weekends. The company needs to invest in more bikes during peak hours to fulfill users' demands. Also, bike maintenance could be implemented during off-peak hours, like between 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM on workdays and between 3:00 AM to 7:00 AM on weekends.

If drilling down the trip starts time by weekday and hour chart by gender, males are the majority of users of the bike-sharing program. The trip distribution over the weekdays and hours confirms the conclusion that the vast majority of users use bike-sharing programs for commute during weekdays.

In the trips by gender and user type chart, the majority of users are subscribers, subscribers have more trips during the weekdays, and customers have more trips during weekends. Subscribers tend to be local users as they use bike-sharing services to commute during weekdays. Customers are more likely to be tourists as their trips are highly concentrated during weekends.

### Trips by Age
The chart of trips by age shows that younger people are more likely to use the bike-sharing program. Interestingly, people born in 1969 have a notable spike in the number of trips, which stands out from all the other age groups. Further investigation is needed to determine if the data is valid and why the case. Generally, younger users have longer bike usage time than older users based on the average trip duration by age chart. 

### Summary
This analysis has given insights into the utilization of the NYC Bike-Sharing Program. The analysis shows that users make heavy use of bike-sharing services during morning and afternoon commute hours on weekdays. Weekend usage is more evenly distributed throughout the day. Whether people use this program for commuting or traveling around the city, there is enough evidence that this bike-sharing program applies to other cities. 
Further analysis can be applied to investigate other months of the year to find out if the bike-sharing business has a stable amount of users trough out the year. Are there enough users during the cold months? Is there a seasonal usage pattern throughout the year? With these questions answered, the company could be more prepared to arrange the number of bikes available for each month/season. Also, as bike usage shows different patterns on weekdays and weekends, we should conduct further analysis to compare trip durations on weekdays and weekends. And if there is any difference between start locations and end locations for trips on weekdays and weekends. Furthermore, the company should compare the demographic information between the two cities to adjust the program locally in Des Moines.
